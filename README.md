# A Rust Playground
## Chill, this is not meant for production. it is not "prod ready"
 

### Technical & design choices

Every design and tech decision were taken based in order of importance by: what I want to experiment/discover, what I like, what's been recommended to me by the Rust community

### Choices

to gain time, and give a minimum viable product, I overlooked several things:

- database initialization
- security (errors returned to the client, etc...)
- proper typing 
- error and exception handling
- clean architecture patterns
- validating and/or escaping user input

### Tech Stack

- Rust
- Socketio
- React for the frontend

### Notes

- broadcasting
